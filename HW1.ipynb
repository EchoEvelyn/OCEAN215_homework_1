    "Although the goal of OCEAN 215 is not to teach \"data science\" per se, we hope this course will give you a window into the possibilities offered by data analysis. If you find that you enjoy working with data and writing computer code, you might want to consider a career in academic research or data science. But what is data science, precisely? To better understand this rapidly-growing field, we would like you to read the following article (which should take about 15 minutes), then answer the questions below. There are no wrong answers, but please respond thoughtfully with 2-3 sentences for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "Article: \"What is data science?\" Thinkful. https://www.thinkful.com/blog/what-is-data-science/. Read up until the \"Your Turn\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "> a) What data do you think you have generated today that might, at some point, be analyzed by a data scientist (5 points)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> b) Can you think of an oceanography data set that could be considered \"big data\"? Why would it be classified as such (5 points)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> c) The article describes how machine learning can be useful for making predictions and identifying relationships in data. Can you think of a research question or task in oceanography or your academic area of interest that might benefit from machine learning? Why might machine learning be particularly useful for that task (10 points)?"

    "(a): My exercise data can be used for a data scientist to see my exercise pattern. For example, analyze the relationship between my body weight and exercise time, and then use the model to predict the future pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b): Global ocean heat data set can be considered as \"big data\", as \"big data\" is usually large, complex, and constantly changing. The global heat data set keeps updating and may include ocean heat in diffferent time, region, and other complex factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "(c): In terms of the global ocean heat data, we can utilize machine learning techniques to explore the relationship between heat and the greenhouse gases. After finding the underlying pattern, we can use such model to predict the future development of global ocean heat. Machine learning is a process of using machines to better understand a process or system, and recreate, replicate or augment that system. In some cases, machines process data in order to develop some kind of understanding of the underlying system that generated it. In others, machines process data and develop new systems for understanding it. "

Tidal amplitudes in the Gulf of Mexico are also very small compared to our local Puget Sound tides.\n",

The lists are each the same length, with each index corresponding to a single day.\n",
